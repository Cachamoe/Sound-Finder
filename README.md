# Project 1

This is a website that allows users to use their favorite artists, movies, or TV shows to find songs that relate to them and to discover new artists, along with a Youtube video from that artist.

Here is a link to the deployed project: []

APIs used include:
1) Taste Dive for discovering artists
2) YouTube for video integration
3) Bandsintown for live event dates and info


We have also used Foundations for our CSS Framework and Bideo for the video background.
