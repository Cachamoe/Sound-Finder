# project 1

This is a website to allow users to use their favorite artists, movies, or TV shows to find songs that relate to them, and discover new artists, along with a Youtube video from that artist.

APIs used include:
Taste dive to discover artists
YouTube API for video integration
Songkick for events

We have used Foundations for our CSS Framework and Bideo for the video background.
